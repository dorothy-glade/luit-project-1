# Level Up in Tech Project 1

This repository contains project 1 for Level Up in Tech. 

Level Up Bank is a fictitious fintech startup that offers digital banking services to customers. The company's website is the primary means of acquiring new customers, providing them with information about the services offered, and serving as a platform for them to interact with the bank. Currently, the website is hosted on an on-premises server, which requires a dedicated IT team to manage and maintain it. This creates additional costs for the company, and also adds a level of complexity to the infrastructure. To address these challenges, Level Up Bank has decided to move its website to AWS S3. Here's how it can benefit from this decision: 

1. Cost savings: Hosting a static website on AWS S3 is more cost-effective compared to using an EC2 or on-premises server. This is because AWS S3 charges only for the amount of storage used, and the cost of data transfer is also minimal. On the other hand, an EC2 instance requires additional expenses for compute power, storage, and data transfer.

2. Improved scalability: AWS S3 provides automatic scalability without requiring any additional effort from the company. If the website receives more traffic, AWS S3 can easily handle the increased load without any downtime. 

3. High availability: AWS S3 offers high availability and durability, ensuring that the website is accessible to users at all times. This is achieved through the use of multiple availability zones and redundancy. 

4. Reduced management overhead: Since AWS S3 is a fully managed service, Level Up Bank can reduce the burden of managing and maintaining the website. This frees up the company's IT team to focus on more critical tasks, such as developing new banking features and improving customer experience.
